# Create Documentation

The fake factor environment has ``mkdocs`` already installed. The 
documentation is build from the ``*.md`` files in the ``docs/`` 
folder based on the config file ``mkdocs.yml``.

The documentation page can be produced locally with:
```bash
mkdocs build
```
This results in a new folder ``site/`` where you can have a look at 
how the documentation is rendered. To see the result, open 
``site/index.html`` in the browser of your choice.
